# **Interview Questions**

Hi! This repo is made for you to practice your coding interview skills. For some challenges you will need to research new methods.


## **Rules**
- Don't modify the package.json's scripts.
- Don't modify the tests.


## **Check you have the proper software:**
- Check that you have the latest LTS Node version installed. To do that, open a terminal/cmd window and run:
```
node --version
```
- If it doesn't retrieve you the current version please go to [NodeJS Website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the latest **LTS** version (not current) for your OS.

- We recommend to use **yarn** as your package manager instead of npm. Check that you have installed yarn by typing in your console:
```
yarn version
```
- If it doesn't retrieve you the current version please go to [Yarn Website](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable) and download the latest version for your OS.


## **How to use it:**
- Clone the repo to your projects / dev folder
- CD to the project folder
- Run the command in the terminal :
```
yarn install
```
- Start writing your code in the proper files.
- To run a test for a specific exercise do:
```
yarn test-nameOfTheFile
```
or
```
yarn test
```
to run all the tests.
- Lastly, **don't forget to push your code.**

## **Happy coding!**
